      <p style="text-align: justify">
        I had a supporting role in a modern fantasy. The loyal dog of a villain
        with an angel’s name, Cheon Sa-yeon, and an unfortunate supporting
        character who died on his behalf, Han Yi-gyeol. In order to escape from
        Cheon Sa-yeon and survive, he must use the protagonist, Ha Tae-heon. But
        Ha Tae-heon, who he thought of as a lifeline, was infinitely indifferent
        to him. Rather, Cheon Sa-yeon showed interest. But besides that,
        something strange happened. The events that occurred in the original
        story had advanced, and the gate and monster levels had risen. Even the
        people were “different” from the original. The original version I was
        trying to use was wrong.
