      <p style="text-align: justify">
        Just one step in the wrong direction, and I managed to cross over into a
        different sphere. A newly-made world of a God. In the distance stood a
        small house surrounded by a field. And inside lay a man on a bed.
        According to the God, he was a hero. One who had died in a tragic event.
        Then the next words of the God threw me into a panic. What did you mean
        I needed to save money to return to my original world? Since there was
        nothing else I could do anyway, I dove head first into my goal. Plucked
        some grass. Grew some vegetables. All to earn a steady income.
        Apparently, my profession was the “Hero’s Wife,” but that’s definitely a
        bug, right?
